This repository contains all of the code from Uzsoy et al. (2024) "Variational Inference for Acceleration of SN Ia Photometric Distance Estimation with BayeSN" ([arxiv preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06013)). Necessary data files are included with the first version release (see sidebar). For information about how to run BayeSN (including with VI), please see the official [BayeSN repository](https://github.com/bayesn/bayesn).
